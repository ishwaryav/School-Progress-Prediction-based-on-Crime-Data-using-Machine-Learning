# School-Progress-Prediction-based-on-Crime-Data-using-Machine-Learning
Prediction of a school's progress as Above Average/Average/Below Average based on the crime rate in its locality by building Machine learning algorithms. 
These algorithms learn the attributes of schools and the crime data in their respective localities for the prediction of progress.
The accuracy in classifying the schools' progress is used to determine the most efficient algorithm.
